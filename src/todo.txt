improve linear interpolation routine (booklib currently) -- too slow 
		compared to splines

move wresample and convol into flx.f90 -- done

write trivial routine that checks for NaNs on input
	(numbers not equal to themselves) and
	call that after reading data to decide if
	spectrum is to be skipped
