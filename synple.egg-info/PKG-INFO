        An Easy-to-Use Python Wrapper for the Spectral Synthesis Code Synspec
        
        
        ** install **
        
        Starting in the main synple directory
        
        1- Compile synspec and rotin
        
         Make sure you have a fortran compiler -- gfortran, is expected and
         if you are using a different compiler you will need to modify the
         makefile accordingly.
        
         cd synspec
        
         make
        
         cd ..
         
        2- Download the line list data
        
         Make sure you have wget and a working internet connection
        
         cd linelists
        
         make
        
         cd ..
         
        3- Add the synple directory to your $PYTHONPATH enviromental variable (optional)
        
        4- Make sure you have a working python install!
        
         
        ** test **
        
         Copy one of the model atmospheres in the 'models' folder (e.g. to your working
         directory) and test that the code works. For example if you use the MARCS model
         sun.mod and want to compute the solar spectrum between 6160. and 6164. AA 
         
           synple.py sun.mod 6160. 6164.
         
         or, similarly, from a python interpreter (e.g. ipython)
         
           from synple import syn
        
           x, y, z = syn('ksun.mod', (6160.,6164.))
        
           #and to plot the continuum normalized spectrum
        
           %pylab
        
           plot(x,y/z)
